OFTERSCHWANG, GERMANY�Canadian Erin Mielnski won a slalom Sunday for her first career World Cup victory.

It was a stunning performance by the 21-year-old from Guelph, Ont., who had never placed higher than 13th on the World Cup circuit. She became the first Canadian woman since Betsy Clifford in 1971 to win gold in the slalom.

"This has been my dream for as long as I can remember," said Mielzynski. "This is more than incredible."

Resi Stiegler of the United States finished in a career-best second place, while Marlies Schild of Austria placed third to win the slalom World Cup title for the season.

Marie-Michele Gagnon, of Lac-Etchemin, Que., finished fifth.

First-run leader Tina Maze of Slovenia failed to finish the second run, while overall leader Lindsey Vonn of the United States fell in the first heat.

Mielzynski's previous best results were a pair of 13th-place finishes last year � in a slalom in Decembein Courchevel, France and another slalom in February in Zwiesel, Germany.

She sat fifth after Sunday's first run and made up a lot of time at the bottom of her second run to claim victory.

Mielzynski is a former water-skier who won a silver medal at the 2006 world waterskiing junior championships before focusing full-time on alpine skiing.

Stiegler, whose promising career was set back by several serious injuries, had a pair of fourth-place finishes in 2007, in a slalom and super-combined.

Lena Duerr of Germany, second after the first run, dropped to sixth. Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States, in a tie for third after the first run, made a mistake in the second to finish bottom.

Frida Hansdotter of Sweden, who shared third after the first heat, fell back to seventh.

Schild, winner of six slaloms this season, was assured of the title when Maze failed to finish.
