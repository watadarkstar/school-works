/* The number of stack frames would be created depends on the depth of n,
 the larger the n is the more stack frames would be created.If the answer of
binary(n) has k digits, k stacks frames would be created.For example:
binary(20)=>00101;here, we have five digits for the answer, so five stack
frames is created.  */
